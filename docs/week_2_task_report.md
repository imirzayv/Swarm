# Week 2 Task Report — Detailed Breakdown

**Project:** Vision-Guided Adaptive Area Monitoring with Drone Swarms
**Week:** 2 (Days 11–17), April 6–17, 2026
**Status:** In progress — Days 11–12 completed

---

## Overview

Week 2 focuses on **robustness, scalability, and validation**. The goal is to
ensure the system handles 5 drones + 10 targets, dry-run all 5 experiment
configurations (E1–E5 including ablations), and complete a 20-paper literature
review. All 3 novel elements were implemented on Day 12.

---

## Day 11 (Apr 6) — Simulation Realism & Scalability ✅ COMPLETED

**Planned tasks (from `adaptive_area_monitoring.md`):**
- Enhance `spawn_targets.sh`: `--count N`, `--random`, `--seed S`
- Extend `camera_bridge.yaml` for 5 drones
- Test 5-drone launch

**Actual work completed:**

### 1. Custom Gazebo World — Shadow Removal
- **Problem:** Drone shadows on ground plane caused YOLO false positives
  (classified as "kite", "airplane").
- **Solution:** Created `worlds/default.sdf` — copy of PX4's default world
  with `<shadows>false</shadows>` and `<cast_shadows>false</cast_shadows>`.
- **Challenge:** PX4's `gz_env.sh` overrides `PX4_GZ_WORLDS` at startup,
  so external env vars have no effect.
- **Final approach:** Symlink `worlds/default.sdf` into PX4's worlds directory
  as `swarm_default.sdf`, set `PX4_GZ_WORLD=swarm_default`.
- **Files changed:** `worlds/default.sdf` (new), `scripts/launch_multi_drone.sh`
- **Doc:** `docs/gazebo_disable_shadows.md`

### 2. Realistic Target Objects (Gazebo Fuel Vehicles)
- **Problem:** Geometric shapes (boxes, cylinders) are not in the COCO dataset.
  YOLOv8 cannot reliably detect them.
- **Solution:** Rewrote `scripts/spawn_targets.sh` to use 3D vehicle models
  from Gazebo Fuel: SUV, Hatchback, Hatchback Red, Hatchback Blue, Pickup.
- **COCO classes:** `car`, `truck` — reliably detected by YOLOv8.
- **Models downloaded from:** `https://fuel.gazebosim.org/1.0/OpenRobotics/models/`
- **Dropped models:** Prius (Ogre1 `<script>` materials → black), Bus (broken
  `model://suv/...` wheel texture references).
- **Texture fix:** Patched `.mtl` files in `~/.gz/fuel/` cache for hatchback
  variants — bare filenames and `model://` URIs replaced with correct relative
  paths (`../materials/textures/filename.png`). Copied missing `wheels3.png`
  from base hatchback to red/blue variants.
- **Files changed:** `scripts/spawn_targets.sh` (rewritten)
- **Doc:** `docs/gazebo_fuel_targets.md`

### 3. Monitoring Area Scaled to 200×200m
- **Previous:** 40×40m area — too small for meaningful swarm coverage experiments.
- **New:** 200×200m area. Targets spread 40–60m apart, 60m+ from origin.
- **Target positions:**
  | Model | X | Y |
  |-------|---|---|
  | SUV | 70 | -60 |
  | Hatchback Red | -80 | 70 |
  | Hatchback Blue | 50 | 80 |
  | Pickup | -60 | -50 |
  | Hatchback | 85 | -30 |
- **Files changed:** `scripts/run_experiment.sh` (`AREA_SIZE=200`),
  `scripts/spawn_targets.sh` (new positions)

### 4. Dynamic Camera Bridge for N Drones
- **Problem:** `camera_bridge.yaml` was hardcoded for 3 drones. Adding drone 4
  or 5 required manual YAML editing.
- **Solution:** `run_experiment.sh` and `run_adaptive.sh` now generate the
  camera bridge YAML at runtime based on `NUM_DRONES`:
  ```bash
  for i in $(seq 1 $NUM_DRONES); do
      cat >> "$BRIDGE_YAML" <<YAML
  - ros_topic_name: /drone${i}/camera/image_raw
    gz_topic_name: /world/${GZ_WORLD}/model/x500_mono_cam_down_${i}/...
  YAML
  done
  ```
- Uses `ros2 run ros_gz_bridge parameter_bridge` instead of launch file.
- **Files changed:** `scripts/run_experiment.sh`, `scripts/run_adaptive.sh`

### 5. Detection Coordinate Bug Fix
- **Problem:** `data_logger.py` logged `msg.world_position` (drone-relative
  offsets) as global coordinates. Detections appeared scattered randomly on plots.
- **Fix:** Added `self._last_pos` dict to track each drone's last known position.
  Detection callback now computes `global_x = drone_x + offset_x`.
- **Files changed:** `scripts/data_logger.py`

### 6. Flight Path Visualization Tool
- **Created:** `scripts/plot_paths.py` — generates combined + per-drone path plots.
- **Features:**
  - Colored flight path lines per drone
  - Start markers (▲) and end markers (■)
  - Ground-truth target positions (red ✕ markers)
  - Detection locations (gold ★ markers)
  - Auto-scaled bounds (handles drones starting outside monitoring area)
  - Legend placed outside plot to avoid overlap
  - Supports `--targets-file` for custom target CSV
- **Integrated into:** `run_experiment.sh` (auto-generates after metrics computation)
- **Files created:** `scripts/plot_paths.py`

### 7. Attempted Realistic Environment — Reverted
- Downloaded House 1/2/3 and Oak/Pine Tree from Gazebo Fuel.
- All house models rendered solid black (Ogre1 `<script>` materials incompatible
  with Gazebo Harmonic's Ogre2 renderer).
- Attempted PBR injection into DAE files — unsuccessful.
- **Decision:** Reverted to plain ground plane. Focus on vehicle targets only.

### Day 11 Deviations from Plan
| Planned | Actual | Reason |
|---------|--------|--------|
| `--count N`, `--random`, `--seed S` for spawn_targets.sh | `NUM_TARGETS` arg only, no random/seed yet | Focused on replacing geometric shapes with Fuel models first; completed on Day 12 |
| Extend camera_bridge.yaml for 5 drones | Dynamic generation at runtime | Better solution — works for any N |
| Test 5-drone launch | Not tested yet | Shadow/target issues took priority |

---

## Day 12 (Apr 7) — Novel Elements + Ablation Baselines ✅ COMPLETED

**Planned tasks (from `adaptive_area_monitoring.md` Days 6–9, compressed):**
- Implement all 3 novel elements
- Create ablation baselines
- Multi-class target spawning

**Actual work completed:**

### 1. SwarmMode.msg ROS 2 Message
- New message type for explore/exploit mode transitions
- Fields: mode (EXPLORE/EXPLOIT), exploit_drone_ids[], event_class, event_position, event_confidence
- Added to `CMakeLists.txt` for build
- **Files:** `ros2_ws/src/swarm_msgs/msg/SwarmMode.msg`, `CMakeLists.txt`

### 2. Configuration File (`config/adaptive_params.yaml`)
- Class priorities: person=0.9, vehicle/car/truck=0.6, fire=1.0
- Class-specific formations:
  - person → cluster (2 drones, 3m radius)
  - vehicle → chain (2 drones, 8m separation)
  - fire → perimeter (3 drones, 10m radius)
- Exploit parameters: confidence_threshold=0.4, timeout=30s, confidence_drop=0.2
- **Files:** `config/adaptive_params.yaml` (new)

### 3. Novel Element 2: Confidence-Weighted Density (voronoi_utils.py)
- `DetectionEvent` expanded with `confidence`, `class_priority`, `class_name`
- `DensityMap` supports `confidence_weighted` flag:
  - True: `weight = confidence × class_priority` (novel)
  - False: `weight = 1.0` (binary — for ablation baseline)
- **Files:** `scripts/voronoi_utils.py`

### 4. Novel Element 1: Class-Specific Response Selector
- `ResponseSelector` class loads formation configs from YAML
- `select_exploit_drones()`: picks K nearest drones, respects `min_explore`
- `compute_formation()`: cluster/chain/perimeter layouts around detection
- **Files:** `scripts/response_selector.py` (new)

### 5. Novel Element 3: Dual-Mode Coordinator (voronoi_coordinator.py rewrite)
- `ExploitEvent` class tracks active exploitation (class, position, timeout)
- On high-confidence detection → enters exploit mode:
  - K nearest drones fly class-specific formation
  - Remaining drones continue Voronoi coverage
- Reform after timeout or confidence drop
- Publishes `SwarmMode` on `/swarm/mode`
- Auto-discovers `config/adaptive_params.yaml`
- **Files:** `scripts/voronoi_coordinator.py` (rewritten)

### 6. Ablation Baseline: Binary Voronoi
- Same Voronoi algorithm, but `confidence_weighted=False`
- All detections weighted equally (1.0) regardless of confidence/class
- No split-and-reform (all drones in Voronoi)
- Isolates contribution of Novel Element 2
- **Files:** `scripts/baselines/binary_voronoi.py` (new)

### 7. Ablation Baseline: All-Converge
- Uses confidence × priority weighting (same as full system)
- But ALL drones converge on detections (no split-and-reform)
- No class-specific formations
- Isolates contribution of Novel Element 3
- **Files:** `scripts/baselines/all_converge.py` (new)

### 8. Multi-Class Target Spawning (spawn_targets.sh)
- New flags: `--classes person,vehicle,fire`, `--count N`, `--random`, `--seed S`
- Person models: Rescue Randy, Casual female (Gazebo Fuel)
- Fire model: inline SDF orange box (3×3m ground patch)
- Legacy positional args still supported for backwards compatibility
- **Files:** `scripts/spawn_targets.sh` (rewritten)

### 9. Data Logger + Metrics Updates
- `data_logger.py`: subscribes to `/swarm/mode`, logs to `swarm_mode.csv`
- `metrics_compute.py`: new `compute_coverage_during_event()` — computes
  coverage % during exploit vs explore periods
- **Files:** `scripts/data_logger.py`, `scripts/metrics_compute.py`

### 10. Experiment Automation Updates
- `run_experiment.sh`: added `binary_voronoi`, `all_converge` methods; `--classes` flag
- `run_all_experiments.sh`: added E5 ablation study batch
- `run_adaptive.sh`: updated defaults (area=200m, altitude=40m, sigma=15m)
- **Files:** `scripts/run_experiment.sh`, `scripts/run_all_experiments.sh`, `scripts/run_adaptive.sh`

### 11. Documentation
- Created `docs/custom_messages.md`: complete reference for all 3 ROS 2 messages
- Updated `docs/baselines.md`: added binary_voronoi, all_converge, ablation study design
- Updated `docs/progress_report.md`: Day 7 entry, architecture diagram, file lists
- **Files:** `docs/custom_messages.md` (new), `docs/baselines.md`, `docs/progress_report.md`

## Day 13 (Apr 12) — Edge Cases + Tuning ⬜ PENDING

**Planned tasks:**
- [ ] Handle edge cases:
  - No detections → uniform Voronoi (already implemented in coordinator)
  - Same target seen by all drones → cap exploit set via `min_explore_drones`
  - Drone disconnection → skip in Voronoi computation
  - Simultaneous multi-class events → prioritize by class_priority
- [ ] Profile CPU/GPU utilization during full pipeline
- [ ] Verify parameters in `config/adaptive_params.yaml`

**Key parameters to tune:**
| Parameter | Current | Range to Test |
|-----------|---------|---------------|
| `AREA_SIZE` | 200m | 100–200m |
| `ALTITUDE` | 40m | 20–40m |
| `CONFIDENCE` | 0.15 | 0.10–0.30 |
| `detection_weight` | 10.0 | 5.0–20.0 |
| `detection_sigma` | 15.0m | 5.0–20.0m |
| `decay_half_life` | 30s | 15–60s |
| `exploit_confidence_threshold` | 0.4 | 0.3–0.5 |
| `exploit_timeout_s` | 30s | 20–45s |

  - 3 drones, 5 mixed-class targets, 120s duration
- [ ] Verify data logging produces valid CSVs for all 6 methods
- [ ] Verify `swarm_mode.csv` is generated for adaptive method
- [ ] Verify metrics computation works on all trial data (including coverage-during-event)
- [ ] Verify path plot generation for all trials
- [ ] Debug process cleanup between consecutive trials

**Expected output per trial:**
```
data/logs/<method>_d3_t5_trial0X/
├── positions.csv
├── detections.csv
├── waypoints.csv
├── swarm_mode.csv     (adaptive only)

## Day 14 (Apr 14) — Dry Run: E2 + E3 ⬜ PENDING

**Planned tasks:**
- [ ] E2 — Scalability: adaptive, **5 drones**, 5 targets, 2 trials
  - First real test with 5 drones
  - Monitor Gazebo performance (FPS, memory)
  - Verify camera bridge works for drones 4 and 5
- [ ] E3 — Target density: adaptive, 3 drones, **10 targets**, 2 trials
  - Requires `spawn_targets.sh` to support >5 targets (positions 6–10 already
    defined in the script)
  - Test how coordinator handles high-density detection events

**Risk:** Gazebo may struggle with 5 drones + cameras. Mitigation: reduce
camera resolution to 320×240, process every 10th frame in detection_publisher.

---

## Day 15 (Apr 15) — Response Time Instrumentation (E4) ⬜ PENDING

**Planned tasks:**
- [ ] Add timestamps to coordinator for reconfiguration timing:
  - `t_detect`: when detection message received
  - `t_publish`: when new waypoints published
  - `t_arrive`: when all affected drones reach new positions (within threshold)
- [ ] Log reconfiguration events to a separate CSV:
  ```
  timestamp, detection_id, t_detect, t_publish, t_arrive, reconfig_time_s
  ```
- [ ] Dry run E4: 2 trials, verify reconfiguration time is captured
